This project is the work of Damon Khan and Riley Cochrane for COMP-317 Assignment 01.

The MakeRuns class does not work 100% correct for heap sizes > the number of datum being read in. It does still create runs in an ordered fashion, but I believe the heap shouldn't create more than a single run if the heap is able to contain all of that data at once.

We also lost about 3-days worth of code for our mergeRuns.java file. As such, the file we are uploading at this stage is incomplete. We have emailed Tony regarding this.

Project has been created as a Java package comprising 3 java files: MinHeap.java, MakeRuns.java and mergeRuns.java. As such,
package compilation is necessary in order to correctly compile and run the Java Classes.

To do:

1) cd into the directory that contains all 3 .java files
2) force the compiler to create a package in the current directory by typing: javac -d . MinHeap.java MakeRuns.java mergeRuns.java
3) a directory called 'runs' will be created in the current working directory indicating that compilation was successful.
4) add the txt file to the 'runs' directory. This is crucial - program will not run if the txt file is not added to 'runs'.
4) to run the class files, invoke the package by typing: java runs.MakeRuns or java runs.mergeRuns (Be sure to add the appropriate program arguments)
5) the output file will be created within the 'runs' directory.
